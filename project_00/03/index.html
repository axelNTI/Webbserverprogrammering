        'Grand Playset 3.10' is a mod collection I have created currently
        consisting of 214 mods, some of which I have developed myself, for the
        game Stellaris with roughly 98.6% positive reviews and 8 awards. 264
        people currently has the playset marked as favourite and nearly 500
        people have downloaded it. It is a combination of some of the most
        ambitious and popular mods for Stellaris including Gigastructural
        Engineering, Ancient Cache of Technologies, Planetary Diversity, New
        Ship Classes, Ethics and Civics: Bug Branch, Ruling Class, and many
        more.
